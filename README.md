ReInvest is a DeFi platform that lets people delegate borrowing power to professional investors and other users, thereby allowing them to earn passively from supplying funds to the protocol and accessing the other proposed upsides from the users to whom their borrowing power has been delegated. The product will be powered by Aave’s credit delegation system and smart contracts.

Reinvest works in 2 parts:

1. A lending & borrowing system for users
2. Credit delegation mechanism.

Users supply assets to Aave’s liquidity pools and receive borrowing credits in GHO value.

The borrowing credit can then be delegated by the user to vaults on ReInvest that serve as investment vehicles.

A vault can be created by any 3rd party. To create a vault, a deposit equal to at least 70% of the total funds that can be accepted into the vault is required. This deposit will serve as insurance in case any unforeseen events occur that lead to loss of funds. The borrowing credit delegated to the vault can be used to mint GHO and then be utilized by the vault owner in accordance to the agreement between the credit delegator and the vault owner.
